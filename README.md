# SymptoMed ~ Where you come first
A Java application that helps in early detection of diseases from users' symptoms and lifestyle choices. Through a secure login system, the application allows users to create their healthcare profiles. After a quick lifestyle survey, they can choose their symptoms. As the user continues to choose, SymptoMed simultaneously updates a new list of symptoms to choose from. Once the most likely diseases are found, users can find detailed information including causes, treatments, ongoing research, and find links to websites with extended reading. The program saves the userâ€™s healthcare record and disease history so they can show it to their doctor. SymptoMed finds the most probable disease from a comprehensive database of diseases and disorders found globally. The ultimate goal is to make a software program that people would truly find useful for diagnosis of diseases, so that patients are informed before they go to doctors for further diagnosis and treatment.

Major skills used include a variety of data structures (Linked List, HashMap, Set, HashSet, ArrayList), OOP, Recursion, Swing & AWT (Scrollable Panels, JTextFields and JPasswordFields), file handling (.txt, .csv), data collection & massaging.
