Unlike some others types of abdominal pain the pain associated with acute cholecystitis is usually persistent and doesn't go away within a few hours.","The causes of acute cholecystitis can be grouped into 2 main categories: calculous cholecystitis and acalculous cholecystitis.

Calculous cholecystitis
Calculous cholecystitis is the most common and usually less serious type of acute cholecystitis. It accounts for around 95% of all cases.

Calculous cholecystitis develops when the main opening to the gallbladder called the cystic duct gets blocked by a gallstone or by a substance known as biliary sludge.

Biliary sludge is a mixture of bile (a liquid produced by the liver that helps digest fats) and small crystals of cholesterol and salt.

The blockage in the cystic duct results in a build-up of bile in the gallbladder increasing the pressure inside it and causing it to become inflamed. In around 1 in every 5 cases the inflamed gallbladder also becomes infected by bacteria.

Acalculous cholecystitis
Acalculous cholecystitis is a less common but usually more serious type of acute cholecystitis. It usually develops as a complication of a serious illness infection or injury that damages the gallbladder.

Acalculous cholecystitis is often associated with problems such as accidental damage to the gallbladder during major surgery serious injuries or burns blood poisoning (sepsis) severe malnutrition or AIDS.","Initial treatment will usually involve:                                                                                                                                                  fasting (not eating or drinking) to take the strain off your gallbladder

This stage of gum disease is called gingivitis.  If gingivitis is untreated the tissues and bone that support the teeth can also become affected. This is known as periodontitis or periodontal disease. In rare cases a condition called acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG) can develop suddenly.","""Gum disease can be caused by a number of factors but poor oral hygiene is the most common cause.

Poor oral hygiene such as not brushing your teeth properly or regularly can cause plaque to build up on your teeth.  Your mouth is full of bacteria that combine with saliva to form a sticky film known as plaque which builds up on your teeth.

When you consume food and drink high in carbohydrates (sugary or starchy foods) bacteria in plaque turn carbohydrates into the energy they need producing acid at the same time.

Over time acid in plaque begins to break down your tooth's surface and causes tooth decay.

Other bacteria in plaque can also irritate your gums making them inflamed and sore.

Plaque is usually easy to remove by brushing and flossing your teeth but it can harden and form a substance called tartar if it's not removed. Tartar sticks much more firmly to teeth than plaque and can usually only be removed by a dentist or dental hygienist.                                     If you develop gingivitis and don't have the plaque or tartar (hardened plaque) removed from your teeth the condition may get worse and lead to periodontitis.
You may develop further complications if you don't treat periodontitis (where the tissue that supports teeth is affected).

This is usually as a result of the arteries that supply the heart muscle becoming hardened and narrowed.

It's a common condition among older adults. The two main types of angina are stable angina and unstable angina. If you have stable angina symptoms will usually develop gradually over time and follow a set pattern. For example you may only experience symptoms when climbing stairs or if you are under a lot of stress. Stable angina isn't life threatening on its own but is a sign that your arteries supplying blood to your heart muscle are narrowing. This means you have an increased risk of experiencing more serious conditions such as a heart attack. If you have unstable angina symptoms can develop rapidly and can persist even when you are at rest. They may continue for some time. Unstable angina should be regarded as a medical emergency because it is a sign that the blood supply to and the function of your heart is compromised increasing your risk of having a heart attack.","Like all the body’s organs and tissues your heart needs a constant supply of oxygen-rich blood to function normally. It gets this supply through the three main coronary arteries.These are the: right coronary artery
left coronary artery and circumflex artery.
In some people a fatty deposit (atheroma) builds up in the lining of the arteries throughout the body over a number of years. This deposit narrows the artery and eventually reduces the amount of blood that can get through. This process is called atherosclerosis. Anything that causes the coronary arteries to narrow is a risk factor for both stable and unstable angina.  If the deposit or plaque bursts it can become more unstable and will interfere with the normal flow of blood. This may cause a blood clot to form. This blood clot can enlarge and severely narrow or block one of the coronary arteries and seriously reduce the blood supply to the heart. This can trigger the symptoms of unstable angina.",If you have angina frequently it's likely that you'll need two or more drugs to relieve the pain to prevent the pain from developing and to protect you from serious events such as heart attacks.

rheumatoid arthritis.  Osteoarthritis initially affects the smooth cartilage lining of the joint. This makes movement more difficult than usual leading to pain and stiffness. Once the cartilage lining starts to roughen and thin out the tendons and ligaments have to work harder. This can cause swelling and the formation of bony spurs called osteophytes. Severe loss of cartilage can lead to bone rubbing on bone altering the shape of the joint and forcing the bones out of their normal position. The most commonly affected joints are those in the: hands spine knees hips.             Rheumatoid arthritis occurs when the body's immune system targets affected joints which leads to pain and swelling. The outer covering (synovium) of the joint is the first place affected. This can then spread across the joint leading to further swelling and a change in the joint's shape. This may cause the bone and cartilage to break down.","There's no cure for arthritis but there are many treatments that can help slow down the condition.

For osteoarthritis medications are often prescribed including:painkillers
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) corticosteroids.          Treatment for rheumatoid arthritis aims to slow down the condition's progress and minimise joint inflammation or swelling. This is to try and prevent damage to the joints. Recommended treatments include:

It's particularly common in men over 50 years of age and isn't usually a serious threat to health. The prostate is a small gland found only in men located in the pelvis between the penis and bladder. It's involved in the production of semen.

The prostate produces a thick white fluid that's made into a thinner liquid by a protein called prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The liquid is then mixed with sperm produced by the testicles to create semen.

If the prostate becomes enlarged it can place pressure on the bladder and urethra (the tube through which urine passes). This can affect how you pass urine.                                                                                                    Benign prostate enlargement can sometimes lead to complications such as a urinary tract infection (UTI) or acute urinary retention. The symptoms of benign prostate enlargement are similar to those of other conditions including prostate cancer. Therefore doctor will make sure that symptoms aren't caused by cancer.",The exact cause of benign prostate enlargement is unknown but research suggests that hormones probably play an important role in the condition's development.  One theory is that as some men get older the levels of a type of hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT) increases which may stimulate the growth of the prostate.  Another theory suggests that two hormones testosterone and oestrogen play a role. Younger men produce high levels of testosterone and much smaller levels of oestrogen. But as men get older their levels of testosterone decrease which means they then have a higher proportion of oestrogen in their body. It's been suggested that the relative increase in oestrogen may stimulate prostate growth.,"Treatment for an enlarged prostate is determined by the severity of your symptoms.

If you have mild to moderate symptoms you won't receive any immediate medical treatment but you'll have regular check-ups to carefully monitor your prostate.

You'll probably also be advised to make lifestyle changes such as limiting your caffeine and alcohol intake and exercising regularly to see if they improve your symptoms.

As well as lifestyle changes medication is usually recommended to treat moderate to severe symptoms of benign prostate enlargement. Finasteride and dutasteride are medications that are commonly used.  Alpha blockers may also be prescribed. They help to relax your bladder muscles making it easier to pass urine.

If you do need help managing your pain or if you need treatment your doctor might recommend that you:
Eliminate an underlying cause or aggravating factor. This may involve a simple adjustment such as wearing a bra with extra support.
Use a topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) medication. Y
Adjust birth control pills. 
Reduce the dose of menopausal hormone therapy. 
Take a prescription medication. Danazol is the only prescription medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating fibrocystic breasts. However danazol carries the risk of potentially severe side effects such as heart and liver problems as well as weight gain and voice changes.

They lead to smaller and smaller airways inside your lungs known as bronchioles.

The walls of the bronchi produce mucus to trap dust and other particles that could otherwise cause irritation.

Most cases of acute bronchitis develop when an infection causes the bronchi to become irritated and inflamed which causes them to produce more mucus than usual. Your body tries to shift this extra mucus through coughing.

Smoking is the most common cause of chronic bronchitis. Over time tobacco smoke can cause permanent damage to the bronchi causing them to become inflamed.","Most cases of bronchitis do not require treatment from a GP and the symptoms can be easily managed at home.

There is no cure for chronic bronchitis but healthy living will help. In particular you should stop smoking if you smoke.     If you have bronchitis: get plenty of rest drink lots of fluids – this helps prevent dehydration and thins the mucus in your lungs making it easier to cough up
treat headaches fever and aches and pains with paracetamol or ibuprofen – although ibuprofen is not recommended if you have asthma.

Two strains of the HPV virus (HPV 16 and HPV 18) are known to be responsible for 70% of all cases of cervical cancer. These types of HPV infection don't have any symptoms so many women won't realise they have the infection.

However it's important to be aware that these infections are relatively common and most women who have them don't develop cervical cancer.

Over time the walls of your arteries can become furred up with fatty deposits. This process is known as atherosclerosis and the fatty deposits are called atheroma. If your coronary arteries become narrow due to a build up of atheroma the blood supply to your heart will block your arteries.

If a coronary artery becomes partially blocked it can cause chest pains (angina). If it becomes completely blocked it can cause a heart attack (myocardial infarction).","Coronary heart disease (CHD) is usually caused by a build up of fatty deposits on the walls of the coronary arteries. The fatty deposits called atheroma are made up of cholesterol and other waste substances.

The build up of atheroma on the walls of the coronary arteries makes the arteries narrower and restricts the flow of blood to the heart. This process is called atherosclerosis. Your risk of developing atherosclerosis is significantly increased if you:
smoke
have high blood pressure
have a high blood cholesterol level
do not take regular exercise
have a thrombosis (blood clot in an artery or vein)
have diabetes

being obese or overweight and
having a family history of heart attack or angina.
",Coronary heart disease cannot be cured but recent progress in the research and development of new medicines and significant improvements in surgical procedures have meant that the condition can now be managed more effectively. With the right treatment the symptoms of coronary heart disease can be reduced and the functioning of the heart improved.     Many different medicines are used to treat CHD such as aspirinanticoagulants statins beta blockers ACE inhibitors anti arrhythmic medicines and nitrates.                  If your blood vessels are very narrow due to a build up of atheroma (fatty deposits) or if your symptoms cannot be controlled using medication surgery may be needed to open up or replace the blocked arteries. Coronary angioplasty is sometimes used to treat mild coronary heart disease. An angioplasty opens up a blocked or narrowed coronary artery improving the blood flow to the heart. A coronary artery bypass may be used which is a procedure that allows the blood flowing through the coronary artery to bypass (get round) the part of the artery that is blocked. In a small number of cases when the heart is severely damaged and medicine is not effective or when the heart becomes less efficient at pumping blood around the body (heart failure) a heart transplant may be needed.

Your risk of developing dementia increases as you get older and the condition usually occurs in people over the age of 65.

Dementia is a syndrome (a group of related symptoms) associated with an ongoing decline of the brain and its abilities. This includes problems with:

memory loss
thinking speed
mental agility
language
understanding
judgement
People with dementia can become apathetic or uninterested in their usual activities and have problems controlling their emotions. They may also find social situations challenging lose interest in socialising and aspects of their personality may change.

A person with dementia may lose empathy (understanding and compassion) they may see or hear things that other people do not (hallucinations) or they may make false claims or statements. 

As dementia affects a person's mental abilities they may find planning and organising difficult. Maintaining their independence may also become a problem. A person with dementia will therefore usually need help from friends or relatives including help with decision making.","Dementia is caused by gradual changes and damage in the brain. The most common causes of dementia include diseases in which the brain cells degenerate and die more quickly than they would as part of the normal ageing process. The changes usually happen because of a build-up of abnormal proteins in the brain.

This damage leads to a decline in a person's mental and sometimes physical abilities.

The abnormal proteins are different in each type of these kinds of dementia. In most cases dementia is not inherited directly from family members. ","Most types of dementia cannot be cured and will gradually cause more severe problems.

But there are important exceptions including dementia caused by vitamin and thyroid hormone deficiencies which can be treated with supplements.

Some causes can be treated surgically – for example some brain tumours excess fluid on the brain (hydrocephalus) or head injury.

For types of dementia that involve degeneration of nerve and brain tissue you can take action to prevent further damage. It's possible to do this by reducing dementia risk factors such as by managing high blood pressure high cholesterol type 1 diabetes and stopping smoking.

For dementia that currently cannot be cured some types of medicine may prevent symptoms getting worse for a period of time. These medicines are usually given to people in the early and middle stages of the disease to try to maintain or improve their independence.

It is fairly common for people with dementia to have depression. If you have dementia and depression your GP may consider prescribing an antidepressant medication or get you an appointment with a psychiatrist who specialises in working with older people.

","Your mouth is full of bacteria which form a sticky film on your teeth called plaque.

If you don't keep your teeth clean acids produced by the bacteria in plaque can damage your teeth and gums leading to tooth decay or gum disease.

The following can increase your chances of developing a dental abscess:

poor oral hygiene – plaque can build-up on your teeth if you don't floss and brush your teeth regularly
consuming lots of sugary or starchy food and drink – these can encourage the growth of bacteria in plaque and may lead to decay that can result in an abscess
an injury or previous surgery to your teeth or gums – bacteria can get into any damaged parts of the teeth or gums
having a weakened immune system – this includes people with certain underlying health conditions such as diabetes and those having treatment including steroid medication or chemotherapy ","Dental abscesses are treated by removing the source of the infection and draining away the pus.

Depending on the location of the abscess and how severe the infection is possible treatments include:

removing the affected tooth (extraction) – this may be necessary if root canal treatment isn't possible
root canal treatment – a procedure to remove the abscess from the root of an affected tooth before filling and sealing it
incision and drainage – where a small cut (incision) is made in the gum to drain the abscess (this is usually only a temporary solution and further treatment may be needed)

There are two main types of diabetes – type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes.

Type 2 diabetes is far more common than type 1.","The amount of glucose in the blood is controlled by a hormone called insulin which is produced by the pancreas (a gland behind the stomach). When food is digested and enters your bloodstream insulin moves glucose out of the blood and into cells where it's broken down to produce energy. However if you have diabetes your body is unable to break down glucose into energy. This is because there's either not enough insulin to move the glucose or the insulin produced doesn't work properly.                                                                                            In type 1 diabetes the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin. As insulin production decreases until no more is produced your glucose levels increase which can seriously damage the body's organs. Type 1 diabetes usually develops before the age of 40 often during the teenage years.                                                                                                       Type 2 diabetes is where the body doesn't produce enough insulin or the body's cells don't react to insulin. This is known as insulin resistance.

If you're diagnosed with type 2 diabetes you may be able to control your symptoms simply by eating a healthy diet exercising regularly and monitoring your blood glucose levels.

However as type 2 diabetes is a progressive condition you may eventually need medication usually in the form of tablets.","It's important that diabetes is diagnosed as early as possible. If left untreated type-1 diabetes is a life-threatening condition. It's essential that treatment is started early.

Diabetes can't be cured but treatment aims to keep your blood glucose levels as normal as possible and control your symptoms to prevent health problems developing later in life.

If you're diagnosed with diabetes you'll be referred to a diabetes care team for specialist treatment and monitoring.

As your body can't produce insulin you'll need regular insulin injections to keep your glucose levels normal. You'll be taught how to do this and how to match the insulin you inject to the food (carbohydrate) you eat taking into account your blood glucose level and how much exercise you do.

Insulin injections come in several different forms with each working slightly differently. You'll most likely need a combination of different insulin preparations.

Flu isn't the same as the common cold. Flu is caused by a different group of viruses and the symptoms tend to start more suddenly be more severe and last longer. It can sometimes be difficult to tell if you have flu or just a cold as the symptoms can be quite similar. The main differences are:

Flu symptoms:
come on quickly
usually include fever and aching muscles
make you feel too unwell to continue your usual activities
Cold symptoms:
come on gradually
mainly affect your nose and throat
are fairly mild so you can still get around and are usually well enough to go to work","Flu is caused by virus. The flu virus is contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when someone who is infected coughs or sneezes.These droplets typically spread about one metre. They hang suspended in the air for a while before landing on surfaces where the virus can survive for up to 24 hours.

Anyone who breathes in the droplets can catch flu. You can also catch the virus by touching the surfaces that the droplets have landed on if you pick up the virus on your hands and then touch your nose or mouth.

Everyday items at home and in public places can easily become contaminated with the flu virus including food door handles remote controls handrails telephone handsets and computer keyboards. Therefore it's important to wash your hands frequently.

You can catch flu many times because flu viruses change regularly and your body won't have a natural resistance to the new versions.","f you're otherwise fit and healthy there's usually no need to see your GP if you have flu-like symptoms.  The best remedy is to rest at home keep warm and drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration. You can take paracetamol or ibuprofen to lower a high temperature and relieve aches if necessary. You should consider seeing your GP if you're at a higher risk of becoming more seriously ill. This includes people who:
are 65 or over
are pregnant
have a lung heart kidney liver or neurological disease
have a weakened immune system 
have diabetes
In these cases your GP may suggest taking antiviral medication.

Lifestyle factors – such as obesity smoking and an unhealthy diet – are believed to increase the risk of gallbladder cancer. However there's not enough evidence to show a firm link between diet and gallbladder cancer.

There are also a number of conditions that can increase your chances of developing gallbladder cancer. For example gallstones cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder) and diabetes have been closely linked to the condition.

If you have a family history of gallstones cholecystitis or gallbladder cancer you're more likely to develop these conditions yourself.","The main treatment for gallbladder cancer is surgery to remove the gallbladder and possibly some of the surrounding tissue.

Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are also sometimes used either on their own or in combination with surgery.

The treatment programme that's most suitable for you will depend on:
the type of gallbladder cancer you have
the stage of your cancer
your overall level of health
As with all cancers the chances of survival depend on how far the condition has advanced when it is diagnosed.

For example if the cancerous cells are confined to the gallbladder lining your chances of living for more than five years are good (about 80%).

However if gallbladder cancer has spread into the surrounding tissue or lymph nodes your chances of living for at least five years are much lower (30%).",https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/gallbladder-cancer/,TRUE,70,100,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,30,50,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE

drinking plenty of fluid – particularly water but avoiding or cutting down on caffeine and alcohol
not delaying going to the toilet – ignoring the urge to empty your bowels can make your stools harder and drier which can lead to straining when you do go to the toilet
avoiding medication that causes constipation – such as painkillers that contain codeine
losing weight (if you're overweight)

The blockage is most often a buildup of fat cholesterol and other substances which form a plaque in the arteries that feed the heart (coronary arteries).

Sometimes a plaque can rupture and form a clot that blocks blood flow. The interrupted blood flow can damage or destroy part of the heart muscle.

A heart attack also called a myocardial infarction can be fatal but treatment has improved dramatically over the years. It's crucial to call 911 or emergency medical help if you think you might be having a heart attack.","A heart attack occurs when one or more of your coronary arteries becomes blocked. Over time a buildup of fatty deposits including cholesterol form substances called plaques which can narrow the arteries (atherosclerosis). This condition called coronary artery disease causes most heart attacks.

During a heart attack a plaque can rupture and spill cholesterol and other substances into the bloodstream. A blood clot forms at the site of the rupture. If the clot is large it can block blood flow through the coronary artery starving the heart of oxygen and nutrients (ischemia). Another cause of a heart attack is a spasm of a coronary artery that shuts down blood flow to part of the heart muscle. Using tobacco and illicit drugs such as cocaine can cause a life-threatening spasm.

heart block,shortness of breath,chest,palpitations or irregular heart beat,heart,dizzy spells or fainting,brain,nausea,mouth,chest pain that gets worse during physical activity,chest,A heart block is when the electrical impulses that control the beating of the heart muscle are disrupted. The most serious type of heart block known as a complete or third degree heart block will have symptoms but often those with less serious heart block can have symptoms too. A first degree heart block is where there is split-second delay in the time that it takes electrical pulses to move through the AV node. First degree heart block does not usually cause any noticeable symptoms and treatment is rarely required. A second degree heart block is where there is a series of increasing delays in the time that it takes the AV node to send the pulse to the ventricle until eventually a heartbeat is skipped.  third degree or complete heart block is where there is no transmission of electrical pulses between the AV node and the ventricles.,"It may sound contradictory but being very fit is one of the most common causes of first degree heart block. For example the condition is widespread among elite long distance runners.This is because vigorous and prolonged exercise can enlarge the heart muscles causing mild disruption to the electrical signals of the heart.  Certain medications can also cause first degree heart block including: 

medications that are used to treat abnormal heart rhythms (antiarrhythmics) such as disopyramide
medications that are used to treat high blood pressure such as calcium channel blockers and beta blockers
digoxin - a medication that is used to treat heart failure

Other causes of first degree heart block include:
myocarditis - inflammation of the heart muscle
low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalaemia)
low levels of magnesium in the blood (hypomagnesemia). Some children who are born with congenital heart disease (heart defects that are present at birth) can also develop second degree heart block. A large proportion of congenital third degree heart block cases develop in mothers who have an autoimmune condition such as lupus (a long-term condition that causes inflammation in the body's tissues).","Treatment is usually only required when a heart block is causing symptoms (symptomatic). This will usually be in cases of type 2 second degree heart block and third degree heart block. Due to the potentially serious nature of symptomatic heart block you will usually be taken immediately to the nearest hospital.  Transcutaneous pacing (TCP) is the treatment of choice for symptomatic heart block. TCP is a way of restoring your normal heartbeat.  During TCP pads will be applied to your chest.

If you are sedated you will be given medication to make you feel drowsy so that you have little or no awareness of what is going on around you.

Heart failure is a serious condition but it does not actually mean that your heart has failed. It means that your heart is not pumping blood around your body very efficiently.

The left side of your heart pumps blood to the body including the brain and kidneys. The right heart pumps blood to the lungs. Heart failure can affect the left or the right side of your heart or both.

Most commonly a problem with function on the left side of the heart produces back pressure leading to additional right heart failure.","n many cases the cause of heart failure is unknown or uncertain.

heart attack (coronary heart disease)
inherited heart disease (for example cardiomyopathy)

In hyperthyroidism the thyroid gland produces too much thyroxine or triiodothyronine which speeds up the body's metabolism.

Iron is used to produce red blood cells which help store and carry oxygen in the blood. If you have fewer red blood cells than is normal your organs and tissues won't get as much oxygen as they usually would.

There are several different types of anaemia and each one has a different cause. Iron deficiency anaemia is the most common type.

Other types of anaemia can be caused by a lack of vitamin B12 or folate in the body. ","There are many things that can lead to a lack of iron in the body. In men and post-menopausal women the most common cause is bleeding in the stomach and intestines.

This can be caused by a stomach ulcer stomach cancer bowel cancer or by taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

In women of reproductive age heavy periods and pregnancy are the most common causes of iron deficiency anaemia as your body needs extra iron for your baby during pregnancy.

Unless you're pregnant it's rare for iron deficiency anaemia to be caused just by a lack of iron in your diet. However if you do lack dietary iron it may mean you're more likely to develop anaemia than if you have one of the problems mentioned above.","Treatment for iron deficiency anaemia involves taking iron supplements to boost the low levels of iron in your body. This is usually effective and the condition rarely causes long-term problems.

You'll need to be monitored every few months to check the treatment is working and your iron levels have returned to normal.

The underlying cause will need to be treated so you don't get anaemia again. Increasing the amount of iron in your diet may also be recommended.

Good sources of iron include:

If treated promptly a kidney infection doesn't cause serious harm but will make you feel very unwell. If a kidney infection isn't treated it can get worse and cause permanent kidney damage.

Symptoms of a kidney infection often come on within a few hours. You can feel feverish shivery sick and have a pain in your back or side.","A kidney infection usually happens when bacteria – often a type called E. coli – gets into the urethra (the tube which carries urine out of the body) and travels up through the bladder and into the kidneys.  The bacteria get in through the opening of the urethra and move upwards through your urinary tract first infecting your bladder and then your kidneys.

It's thought the bacteria can get into your urinary tract by accidentally spreading from your anus to your urethra. This can happen if you wipe your bottom after going to the toilet and the soiled toilet paper comes into contact with your genitals. It can also happen during sex.

In rare cases a kidney infection can develop if bacteria or fungi infect the skin and the infection spreads through your bloodstream into your kidney. However this type of infection usually only occurs in people with weakened immune systems. Kidney infections are relatively rare.  They can happen at any age but are much more common in women. In fact women are six times more likely to get a kidney infection than men. This is because a woman's urethra is shorter making it easier for bacteria to reach the kidneys.

Younger women are most at risk because they tend to be more sexually active and having frequent sex increases the chances of getting a kidney infection.

Younger children are also vulnerable to developing kidney infections because they may be born with an abnormality of the urinary tract or have a condition called vesico-ureteric reflux where there is a backflow of urine from the bladder up to the kidneys.","Most people with a kidney infection can be treated at home with a course of antibiotics and possibly painkillers as well.

See your GP if you have a fever and persistent tummy lower back or genital pain or if you notice a change to your usual pattern of urination.  If you're being treated at home you'll usually be prescribed a course of antibiotic tablets or capsules that lasts between seven and 14 days.

The medical term for kidney stones is nephrolithiasis and if they cause severe pain it's known as renal colic.","The waste products in the blood can occasionally form crystals that collect inside the kidneys. Over time the crystals may build up to form a hard stone-like lump.

This is more likely to happen if you don't drink enough fluids if you're taking some types of medication or if you have a medical condition that raises the levels of certain substances in your urine.  After a kidney stone has formed your body will try to pass it out when you go to the toilet (in the urine). This means it will often travel through the urinary system (the kidneys kidney tubes and bladder).","Most kidney stones are small enough to be passed in your urine and it may be possible to treat the symptoms at home with medication.

Larger stones may need to be broken up using ultrasound or laser energy. Occasionally keyhole surgery may be needed to remove very large kidney stones directly.

This is known as periodontitis or periodontal disease.","Gum disease can be caused by a number of factors but poor oral hygiene is the most common cause.

Poor oral hygiene such as not brushing your teeth properly or regularly can cause plaque to build up on your teeth.  Your mouth is full of bacteria that combine with saliva to form a sticky film known as plaque which builds up on your teeth.

When you consume food and drink high in carbohydrates (sugary or starchy foods) bacteria in plaque turn carbohydrates into the energy they need producing acid at the same time.

Over time acid in plaque begins to break down your tooth's surface and causes tooth decay.

Other bacteria in plaque can also irritate your gums making them inflamed and sore.

Plaque is usually easy to remove by brushing and flossing your teeth but it can harden and form a substance called tartar if it's not removed. Tartar sticks much more firmly to teeth than plaque and can usually only be removed by a dentist or dental hygienist.

Your dentist may recommend using mouthwash if it helps control the build-up of plaque (the sticky substance that forms when bacteria collects on the surface of your teeth). Your dentist will be able to advise you about which type of mouthwash is most suitable and how to use it.  To remove plaque and tartar (hardened plaque) that can build up on your teeth your dentist may suggest that you have your teeth scaled and polished. This is a ""professional clean"" usually carried out at your dental surgery by a dental hygienist. In some cases of gum disease root planing (debridement) may be required.

age – risk rises as you get older and most cases are diagnosed in men over 50 years of age.
ethnic group – prostate cancer is more common among men of African-Caribbean and African descent than in men of Asian descent.
family history – having a brother or father who developed prostate cancer under the age of 60 seems to increase the risk of you developing it. Research also shows that having a close female relative who developed breast cancer may also increase your risk of developing prostate cancer. 
obesity – recent research suggests that there may be a link between obesity and prostate cancer.
exercise – men who regularly exercise have also been found to be at lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
diet – research is ongoing into the links between diet and prostate cancer. There is evidence that a diet high in calcium is linked to an increased risk of developing prostate cancer.
In addition some research has shown that prostate cancer rates appear to be lower in men who eat foods containing certain nutrients including lycopene found in cooked tomatoes and other red fruit and selenium found in brazil nuts.

The hands feet and wrists are commonly affected but it can also cause problems in other parts of the body.

There may be periods where your symptoms become worse known as a flare-up or flare. A flare can be difficult to predict but with treatment it is possible to decrease the number of flares and minimise or prevent long-term damage to the joints.","Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition which means it is caused by the body’s immune system attacking itself. However it is not yet known what triggers this.

Normally your immune system makes antibodies that attack bacteria and viruses helping fight infection. But if you have rheumatoid arthritis your immune system mistakenly sends antibodies to the lining of your joints where they attack the tissue surrounding the joint.

This causes the thin layer of cells (synovium) covering your joints to become sore and inflamed.

This inflammation in turn causes chemicals to be released that thicken the synovium and damage nearby:

bones
cartilage – the stretchy connective tissue between bones
tendons – the tissue that connects bone to muscle
ligaments – the tissue that connects bone and cartilage
If the condition is not treated these chemicals gradually cause the joint to lose its shape and alignment and eventually can destroy the joint completely.

Various theories of why the immune system starts to attack the joints have been suggested including that an infection or virus may trigger this but none of these theories has been proven.
","There is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis but early diagnosis and appropriate treatment enables many people with rheumatoid arthritis to have periods of months or even years between flares and to be able to lead full lives and continue regular employment.

This may occur when wiping your bottom or having sex for example but often it's not clear why it happens.

The following may increase your risk of getting a UTI:

conditions that obstruct your urinary tract such as kidney stones
difficulty emptying your bladder fully
using a contraceptive diaphragm or condoms coated in spermicide
diabetes
a weak immune system – from chemotherapy or HIV for example 
a urinary catheter (a tube in your bladder used to drain urine)
an enlarged prostate gland in men
Women may be more likely to get UTIs because their urethra is shorter than a man's and is closer to their anus (back passage).","UTIs are normally treated with a short course of antibiotics.

Most women are given a three-day course of antibiotic capsules or tablets. Men pregnant women and people with more serious symptoms may need a slightly longer course.

Your symptoms will normally pass within three to five days of starting treatment. But make sure you complete the whole course of antibiotics that you've been prescribed even if you're feeling better.
