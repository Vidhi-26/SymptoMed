However if it becomes large some people may develop a pain or a pulsating feeling in their abdomen (tummy) or persistent back pain.

An AAA doesn’t usually pose a serious threat to health but there’s a risk that a larger aneurysm could burst (rupture).

A ruptured aneurysm can cause massive internal bleeding which is usually fatal. Around 8 out of 10 people with a rupture either die before they reach hospital or don’t survive surgery.

The most common symptom of a ruptured aortic aneurysm is sudden and severe pain in the abdomen.

The main symptom of acute cholecystitis is a sudden sharp pain in the upper right side of your tummy (abdomen) that spreads towards your right shoulder.

The affected part of the abdomen is usually extremely tender and breathing deeply can make the pain worse.

Unlike some others types of abdominal pain the pain associated with acute cholecystitis is usually persistent and doesn't go away within a few hours.","The causes of acute cholecystitis can be grouped into 2 main categories: calculous cholecystitis and acalculous cholecystitis.

Calculous cholecystitis
Calculous cholecystitis is the most common and usually less serious type of acute cholecystitis. It accounts for around 95% of all cases.

Calculous cholecystitis develops when the main opening to the gallbladder called the cystic duct gets blocked by a gallstone or by a substance known as biliary sludge.

Biliary sludge is a mixture of bile (a liquid produced by the liver that helps digest fats) and small crystals of cholesterol and salt.

The blockage in the cystic duct results in a build-up of bile in the gallbladder increasing the pressure inside it and causing it to become inflamed. In around 1 in every 5 cases the inflamed gallbladder also becomes infected by bacteria.

Acalculous cholecystitis
Acalculous cholecystitis is a less common but usually more serious type of acute cholecystitis. It usually develops as a complication of a serious illness infection or injury that damages the gallbladder.

Acalculous cholecystitis is often associated with problems such as accidental damage to the gallbladder during major surgery serious injuries or burns blood poisoning (sepsis) severe malnutrition or AIDS.","Initial treatment will usually involve:                                                                                                                                                  fasting (not eating or drinking) to take the strain off your gallbladder

For example a blockage may be formed by a small piece of faeces or an upper respiratory tract infection could lead to a swollen lymph node within the wall of the bowel.

This obstruction leads to the development of inflammation and swelling. The pressure caused by the swelling can then lead to the appendix bursting.

As the causes aren't fully understood there's no guaranteed way of preventing appendicitis.","In most cases of appendicitis the appendix needs to be surgically removed as soon as possible.  The operation is most commonly performed as keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) which involves making several small cuts in your abdomen through which special surgical instruments are inserted.

Open surgery where a larger single cut is made in the abdomen is usually carried out if the appendix has burst or access is more difficult.

rheumatoid arthritis.  Osteoarthritis initially affects the smooth cartilage lining of the joint. This makes movement more difficult than usual leading to pain and stiffness. Once the cartilage lining starts to roughen and thin out the tendons and ligaments have to work harder. This can cause swelling and the formation of bony spurs called osteophytes. Severe loss of cartilage can lead to bone rubbing on bone altering the shape of the joint and forcing the bones out of their normal position. The most commonly affected joints are those in the: hands spine knees hips.             Rheumatoid arthritis occurs when the body's immune system targets affected joints which leads to pain and swelling. The outer covering (synovium) of the joint is the first place affected. This can then spread across the joint leading to further swelling and a change in the joint's shape. This may cause the bone and cartilage to break down.","There's no cure for arthritis but there are many treatments that can help slow down the condition.

For osteoarthritis medications are often prescribed including:painkillers
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) corticosteroids.          Treatment for rheumatoid arthritis aims to slow down the condition's progress and minimise joint inflammation or swelling. This is to try and prevent damage to the joints. Recommended treatments include:

Occasionally asthma symptoms can get gradually or suddenly worse. This is known as an 'asthma attack' although doctors sometimes use the term 'exacerbation'.

Severe attacks may require hospital treatment and can be life threatening although this is unusual.","Asthma is caused by inflammation of the small tubes called bronchi which carry air in and out of the lungs. If you have asthma the bronchi will be inflamed and more sensitive than normal.

It's particularly common in men over 50 years of age and isn't usually a serious threat to health. The prostate is a small gland found only in men located in the pelvis between the penis and bladder. It's involved in the production of semen.

The prostate produces a thick white fluid that's made into a thinner liquid by a protein called prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The liquid is then mixed with sperm produced by the testicles to create semen.

If the prostate becomes enlarged it can place pressure on the bladder and urethra (the tube through which urine passes). This can affect how you pass urine.

The symptoms of benign prostate enlargement are similar to those of other conditions including prostate cancer. Therefore doctor will make sure that symptoms aren't caused by cancer.",The exact cause of benign prostate enlargement is unknown but research suggests that hormones probably play an important role in the condition's development.  One theory is that as some men get older the levels of a type of hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT) increases which may stimulate the growth of the prostate.  Another theory suggests that two hormones testosterone and oestrogen play a role. Younger men produce high levels of testosterone and much smaller levels of oestrogen. But as men get older their levels of testosterone decrease which means they then have a higher proportion of oestrogen in their body. It's been suggested that the relative increase in oestrogen may stimulate prostate growth.,"Treatment for an enlarged prostate is determined by the severity of your symptoms.

If you have mild to moderate symptoms you won't receive any immediate medical treatment but you'll have regular check-ups to carefully monitor your prostate.

You'll probably also be advised to make lifestyle changes such as limiting your caffeine and alcohol intake and exercising regularly to see if they improve your symptoms.

There are more than 100 different types of HPV many of which are harmless. However some types of HPV can cause abnormal changes to the cells of the cervix which can eventually lead to cervical cancer.

Two strains of the HPV virus (HPV 16 and HPV 18) are known to be responsible for 70% of all cases of cervical cancer. These types of HPV infection don't have any symptoms so many women won't realise they have the infection.

However it's important to be aware that these infections are relatively common and most women who have them don't develop cervical cancer.

There are two main types of diabetes – type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes.

Type 2 diabetes is far more common than type 1.","The amount of glucose in the blood is controlled by a hormone called insulin which is produced by the pancreas (a gland behind the stomach). When food is digested and enters your bloodstream insulin moves glucose out of the blood and into cells where it's broken down to produce energy. However if you have diabetes your body is unable to break down glucose into energy. This is because there's either not enough insulin to move the glucose or the insulin produced doesn't work properly.                                                                                            In type 1 diabetes the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin. As insulin production decreases until no more is produced your glucose levels increase which can seriously damage the body's organs. Type 1 diabetes usually develops before the age of 40 often during the teenage years.                                                                                                       Type 2 diabetes is where the body doesn't produce enough insulin or the body's cells don't react to insulin. This is known as insulin resistance.

If you're diagnosed with type 2 diabetes you may be able to control your symptoms simply by eating a healthy diet exercising regularly and monitoring your blood glucose levels.

However as type 2 diabetes is a progressive condition you may eventually need medication usually in the form of tablets.","It's important that diabetes is diagnosed as early as possible. If left untreated type-1 diabetes is a life-threatening condition. It's essential that treatment is started early.

Diabetes can't be cured but treatment aims to keep your blood glucose levels as normal as possible and control your symptoms to prevent health problems developing later in life.

If you're diagnosed with diabetes you'll be referred to a diabetes care team for specialist treatment and monitoring.

As your body can't produce insulin you'll need regular insulin injections to keep your glucose levels normal. You'll be taught how to do this and how to match the insulin you inject to the food (carbohydrate) you eat taking into account your blood glucose level and how much exercise you do.

Insulin injections come in several different forms with each working slightly differently. You'll most likely need a combination of different insulin preparations.

A normal blood pressure reading is classed as less than 130/80mmHg.","There are two types of high blood pressure:

Primary high blood pressure (also known as essential high blood pressure) - has no identifiable cause.
Secondary high blood pressure - is related to an underlying cause such as kidney disease or a particular type of medication that you are taking. While the specific cause of primary high blood pressure remains unknown there is compelling evidence to suggest that a number of risk factors increase your chances of developing the condition.

heart block,shortness of breath,chest,palpitations or irregular heart beat,heart,dizzy spells or fainting,brain,nausea,mouth,chest pain that gets worse during physical activity,chest,A heart block is when the electrical impulses that control the beating of the heart muscle are disrupted. The most serious type of heart block known as a complete or third degree heart block will have symptoms but often those with less serious heart block can have symptoms too. A first degree heart block is where there is split-second delay in the time that it takes electrical pulses to move through the AV node. First degree heart block does not usually cause any noticeable symptoms and treatment is rarely required. A second degree heart block is where there is a series of increasing delays in the time that it takes the AV node to send the pulse to the ventricle until eventually a heartbeat is skipped.  third degree or complete heart block is where there is no transmission of electrical pulses between the AV node and the ventricles. ,"It may sound contradictory but being very fit is one of the most common causes of first degree heart block. For example the condition is widespread among elite long distance runners.This is because vigorous and prolonged exercise can enlarge the heart muscles causing mild disruption to the electrical signals of the heart.  Certain medications can also cause first degree heart block including: 

medications that are used to treat abnormal heart rhythms (antiarrhythmics) such as disopyramide
medications that are used to treat high blood pressure such as calcium channel blockers and beta blockers
digoxin - a medication that is used to treat heart failure

Other causes of first degree heart block include:
myocarditis - inflammation of the heart muscle
low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalaemia)
low levels of magnesium in the blood (hypomagnesemia). Some children who are born with congenital heart disease (heart defects that are present at birth) can also develop second degree heart block. A large proportion of congenital third degree heart block cases develop in mothers who have an autoimmune condition such as lupus (a long-term condition that causes inflammation in the body's tissues).","Treatment is usually only required when a heart block is causing symptoms (symptomatic). This will usually be in cases of type 2 second degree heart block and third degree heart block. Due to the potentially serious nature of symptomatic heart block you will usually be taken immediately to the nearest hospital.  Transcutaneous pacing (TCP) is the treatment of choice for symptomatic heart block. TCP is a way of restoring your normal heartbeat.  During TCP pads will be applied to your chest. Electrical pulses will then be delivered through the pads and these pulses will be used to correct your heartbeat. TCP can feel uncomfortable so you may be sedated before the procedure begins. If you are sedated you will be given medication to make you feel drowsy so that you have little or no awareness of what is going on around you.

Once your heartbeat has been stabilised a permanent pacemaker may be recommended.                                              A pacemaker is a small electrical device that is similar to a battery and can be inserted into one of your veins before being moved next to your heart. The pacemaker has wires that are inserted into your heart and will generate a regular series of pulses to keep your heart beating.

This is usually as a result of the arteries that supply the heart muscle becoming hardened and narrowed.

It's a common condition among older adults. The two main types of angina are stable angina and unstable angina. If you have stable angina symptoms will usually develop gradually over time and follow a set pattern. For example you may only experience symptoms when climbing stairs or if you are under a lot of stress. Stable angina isn't life threatening on its own but is a sign that your arteries supplying blood to your heart muscle are narrowing. This means you have an increased risk of experiencing more serious conditions such as a heart attack. If you have unstable angina symptoms can develop rapidly and can persist even when you are at rest. They may continue for some time. Unstable angina should be regarded as a medical emergency because it is a sign that the blood supply to and the function of your heart is compromised increasing your risk of having a heart attack.","Like all the body’s organs and tissues your heart needs a constant supply of oxygen-rich blood to function normally. It gets this supply through the three main coronary arteries.These are the: right coronary artery
left coronary artery and circumflex artery.
In some people a fatty deposit (atheroma) builds up in the lining of the arteries throughout the body over a number of years. This deposit narrows the artery and eventually reduces the amount of blood that can get through. This process is called atherosclerosis. Anything that causes the coronary arteries to narrow is a risk factor for both stable and unstable angina.  If the deposit or plaque bursts it can become more unstable and will interfere with the normal flow of blood. This may cause a blood clot to form. This blood clot can enlarge and severely narrow or block one of the coronary arteries and seriously reduce the blood supply to the heart. This can trigger the symptoms of unstable angina.",If you have angina frequently it's likely that you'll need two or more drugs to relieve the pain to prevent the pain from developing and to protect you from serious events such as heart attacks.

Over time the walls of your arteries can become furred up with fatty deposits. This process is known as atherosclerosis and the fatty deposits are called atheroma. If your coronary arteries become narrow due to a build up of atheroma the blood supply to your heart will block your arteries.

If a coronary artery becomes partially blocked it can cause chest pains (angina). If it becomes completely blocked it can cause a heart attack (myocardial infarction).","Coronary heart disease (CHD) is usually caused by a build up of fatty deposits on the walls of the coronary arteries. The fatty deposits called atheroma are made up of cholesterol and other waste substances.

The build up of atheroma on the walls of the coronary arteries makes the arteries narrower and restricts the flow of blood to the heart. This process is called atherosclerosis. Your risk of developing atherosclerosis is significantly increased if you:
smoke
have high blood pressure
have a high blood cholesterol level

being obese or overweight and
having a family history of heart attack or angina.
",Coronary heart disease cannot be cured but recent progress in the research and development of new medicines and significant improvements in surgical procedures have meant that the condition can now be managed more effectively. With the right treatment the symptoms of coronary heart disease can be reduced and the functioning of the heart improved.     Many different medicines are used to treat CHD such as aspirinanticoagulants statins beta blockers ACE inhibitors anti arrhythmic medicines and nitrates.                  If your blood vessels are very narrow due to a build up of atheroma (fatty deposits) or if your symptoms cannot be controlled using medication surgery may be needed to open up or replace the blocked arteries. Coronary angioplasty is sometimes used to treat mild coronary heart disease. An angioplasty opens up a blocked or narrowed coronary artery improving the blood flow to the heart. A coronary artery bypass may be used which is a procedure that allows the blood flowing through the coronary artery to bypass (get round) the part of the artery that is blocked. In a small number of cases when the heart is severely damaged and medicine is not effective or when the heart becomes less efficient at pumping blood around the body (heart failure) a heart transplant may be needed.

Poor oral hygiene such as not brushing your teeth properly or regularly can cause plaque to build up on your teeth.  Your mouth is full of bacteria that combine with saliva to form a sticky film known as plaque which builds up on your teeth.

When you consume food and drink high in carbohydrates (sugary or starchy foods) bacteria in plaque turn carbohydrates into the energy they need producing acid at the same time.

Over time acid in plaque begins to break down your tooth's surface and causes tooth decay.

Other bacteria in plaque can also irritate your gums making them inflamed and sore.

Plaque is usually easy to remove by brushing and flossing your teeth but it can harden and form a substance called tartar if it's not removed.

Normally this ring of muscle opens to let food into your stomach and closes to stop stomach acid leaking back up into your oesophagus.

But for people with GORD stomach acid is able to pass back up into the oesophagus. This causes symptoms of GORD which can include heartburn and acid reflux.

It's not always clear what causes this ring of muscle to become weakened but certain things can increase the risk of it happening. These risk factors include obesity too much of smoking or alcohol coffee and chocolate consumption eating large amount of fatty foods pregnancy hiatus hernia and certain medications. ","The main treatments for GORD are:
self-help measures – this includes eating smaller but more frequent meals avoiding any foods or drinks that trigger your symptoms raising the head of your bed and keeping to a healthy weight
over-the-counter medicines – ask your pharmacist to recommend an antacid or an alginate
stronger prescription medicines – including proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs)

Symptoms develop rapidly over a few hours and typically last three to 10 days. After this time the pain should pass and the joint should return to normal.

Almost everyone with gout will experience further attacks at some point usually within a year.","Gout is caused by small crystals forming in the joints resulting in severe pain tenderness and swelling.

These crystals can grow when a waste product called uric acid starts to build up to high levels in the body. A high level of uric acid in the blood is the main factor that increases your risk of developing gout. However it's still uncertain why some people with a high level of uric acid in the blood develop gout while others with an equally high level don't.

obesity high blood pressure and/or diabetes
having a close relative with gout
kidney problems

There are 2 different types of the virus (type 1 and type 2) both of which can affect the genitals. One of the types is the same virus that causes cold sores around the mouth (type 1).

Genital herpes causes painful blisters and sores on and around the genitals. It can also sometimes cause problems if it's caught for the first time either very early or very late in pregnancy.","Genital herpes is caused by a virus called herpes simplex virus (HSV).

kissing
unprotected vaginal anal or oral sex (without a condom)
sharing sex toys that aren't washed or covered with a new condom each time they're used
your genitals coming into contact with your partner's genitals – this means you can get genital herpes from someone even if there is no penetration orgasm or ejaculation
Sometimes you can catch herpes when your sexual partner has no visible sores or symptoms. This is because the virus can become active on the skin without causing any visible blisters or sores. This is sometimes called 'asymptomatic shedding’.

Herpes can also be passed to a newborn baby during childbirth. This is less common if the first episode of herpes is diagnosed before or at the beginning of pregnancy and if there are no visible ulcers at the time of delivery. ","Although there is no known cure for herpes the symptoms of genital herpes can be treated.

The symptoms of recurrent genital herpes will usually clear up without any treatment. Anti-viral medication can help speed up the healing process and reduce the severity of an episode if needed.

If you start taking the medication as soon as an outbreak begins you may shorten or even stop the episode.

Lifestyle factors – such as obesity smoking and an unhealthy diet – are believed to increase the risk of gallbladder cancer. However there's not enough evidence to show a firm link between diet and gallbladder cancer.

There are also a number of conditions that can increase your chances of developing gallbladder cancer. For example gallstones cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder) and diabetes have been closely linked to the condition.

If you have a family history of gallstones cholecystitis or gallbladder cancer you're more likely to develop these conditions yourself.","The main treatment for gallbladder cancer is surgery to remove the gallbladder and possibly some of the surrounding tissue.

Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are also sometimes used either on their own or in combination with surgery.

the type of gallbladder cancer you have
the stage of your cancer
your overall level of health
As with all cancers the chances of survival depend on how far the condition has advanced when it is diagnosed.

Heart failure is a serious condition but it does not actually mean that your heart has failed. It means that your heart is not pumping blood around your body very efficiently.

The left side of your heart pumps blood to the body including the brain and kidneys. The right heart pumps blood to the lungs. Heart failure can affect the left or the right side of your heart or both.

Most commonly a problem with function on the left side of the heart produces back pressure leading to additional right heart failure.","n many cases the cause of heart failure is unknown or uncertain.

Conditions that can cause heart failure include:
heart attack (coronary heart disease)
inherited heart disease (for example cardiomyopathy)

Psoriasis is a long-lasting (chronic) disease that usually involves periods when you have no symptoms or mild symptoms followed by periods when symptoms are more severe.","Psoriasis occurs when skin cells are replaced more quickly than usual. It's not known exactly why this happens but research suggests it's caused by a problem with the immune system.

Your body produces new skin cells in the deepest layer of skin. These skin cells gradually move up through the layers of skin until they reach the outermost level. Then they die and flake off. This whole process normally takes around 3 to 4 weeks.

A flare can be difficult to predict but with treatment it is possible to decrease the number of flares and minimise or prevent long-term damage to the joints.","Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition which means it is caused by the body’s immune system attacking itself. However it is not yet known what triggers this.

Normally your immune system makes antibodies that attack bacteria and viruses helping fight infection. But if you have rheumatoid arthritis your immune system mistakenly sends antibodies to the lining of your joints where they attack the tissue surrounding the joint.

This causes the thin layer of cells (synovium) covering your joints to become sore and inflamed.

This inflammation in turn causes chemicals to be released that thicken the synovium and damage nearby:

bones
cartilage – the stretchy connective tissue between bones
tendons – the tissue that connects bone to muscle
ligaments – the tissue that connects bone and cartilage
If the condition is not treated these chemicals gradually cause the joint to lose its shape and alignment and eventually can destroy the joint completely.

Various theories of why the immune system starts to attack the joints have been suggested including that an infection or virus may trigger this but none of these theories has been proven.

It's not always possible to prevent womb cancer but some things are thought to reduce your risk. This includes maintaining a healthy weight and the long-term use of some types of contraception.","The most common treatment for womb cancer is the surgical removal of the womb (hysterectomy).

A hysterectomy can cure womb cancer in its early stages but you will no longer be able to get pregnant. Surgery for womb cancer is also likely to include the removal of the ovaries and fallopian tubes.

Radiotherapy or chemotherapy are also sometimes used often in conjunction with surgery.

A type of hormone therapy may be used if you are yet to go through the menopause and would still like to have children.

Even if your cancer is advanced and the chances of a cure are small treatment can still help to relieve symptoms and prolong your life.",https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/womb-uterus-cancer/#about-womb-cancer,TRUE,40,75,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,30.00,50.00,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

It’s caused by a bacterial infection.

An abscess at the end of a tooth is called a periapical abscess. An abscess in the gum is called a periodontal abscess.

Dental abscesses are often painful but aren’t always. In either case they should be looked at by a dentist.

It's important to get help as soon as possible because abscesses don't go away on their own. They can sometimes spread to other parts of the body and make you ill.
","Your mouth is full of bacteria which form a sticky film on your teeth called plaque.

If you don't keep your teeth clean acids produced by the bacteria in plaque can damage your teeth and gums leading to tooth decay or gum disease.

The following can increase your chances of developing a dental abscess:

poor oral hygiene – plaque can build-up on your teeth if you don't floss and brush your teeth regularly
consuming lots of sugary or starchy food and drink – these can encourage the growth of bacteria in plaque and may lead to decay that can result in an abscess
an injury or previous surgery to your teeth or gums – bacteria can get into any damaged parts of the teeth or gums
having a weakened immune system – this includes people with certain underlying health conditions such as diabetes and those having treatment including steroid medication or chemotherapy ","Dental abscesses are treated by removing the source of the infection and draining away the pus.

Depending on the location of the abscess and how severe the infection is possible treatments include:

removing the affected tooth (extraction) – this may be necessary if root canal treatment isn't possible
root canal treatment – a procedure to remove the abscess from the root of an affected tooth before filling and sealing it
incision and drainage – where a small cut (incision) is made in the gum to drain the abscess (this is usually only a temporary solution and further treatment may be needed)
Local anaesthetic will usually be used to numb your mouth for these procedures. More extensive operations may be carried out under general anaesthetic (where you're asleep).

a virus – such as norovirus or rotavirus
bacteria – such as campylobacter and Escherichia coli (E. coli) which are often picked up from contaminated food 
a parasite – such as the parasite that causes giardiasis which is spread in contaminated water
These infections can sometimes be caught during travel abroad particularly to areas with poor standards of public hygiene. This is known as travellers' diarrhoea.

Diarrhoea can also be the result of anxiety a food allergy medication or a long-term condition such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).","Most cases of diarrhoea clear up after a few days without treatment and you may not need to see your GP.

However diarrhoea can lead to dehydration so you should drink plenty of fluids – small frequent sips of water – until it passes. It's very important that babies and small children do not become dehydrated.

Your pharmacist may suggest you use an oral rehydration solution (ORS) if you or your child are particularly at risk of dehydration.

You should eat solid food as soon as you feel able to. If you're breastfeeding or bottle feeding your baby and they have diarrhoea you should try to feed them as normal.

Certain hormones cause the grease-producing glands next to hair follicles in the skin to produce larger amounts of oil (abnormal sebum).

This abnormal sebum changes the activity of a usually harmless skin bacterium called P. acnes which becomes more aggressive and causes inflammation and pus.

The hormones also thicken the inner lining of the hair follicle causing blockage of the pores (opening of the hair follicles). Cleaning the skin doesn't help to remove this blockage. Hormonal changes such as those that occur during the menstrual cycle or pregnancy can also lead to episodes of acne in women.

There's no evidence that diet poor hygiene or sexual activity play a role in acne.","Treatment for acne depends on how severe it is.

People with COPD have difficulties breathing primarily due to the narrowing of their airways this is called airflow obstruction.","The main cause of COPD is smoking. The likelihood of developing COPD increases the more you smoke and the longer you've been smoking. This is because smoking irritates and inflames the lungs which results in scarring.

Over many years the inflammation leads to permanent changes in the lung. The walls of the airways thicken and more mucus is produced. Damage to the delicate walls of the air sacs in the lungs causes emphysema and the lungs lose their normal elasticity. The smaller airways also become scarred and narrowed. These changes cause the symptoms of breathlessness cough and phlegm associated with COPD.

Some cases of COPD are caused by fumes dust air pollution and genetic disorders but these are rarer.","Although the damage that has already occurred to your lungs cannot be reversed you can slow down the progression of the disease. Stopping smoking is particularly effective at doing this.

Treatments for COPD usually involve relieving the symptoms with medication for example by using an inhaler to make breathing easier. Pulmonary rehabilitation may also help increase the amount of exercise you are capable of doing.

Your risk of developing dementia increases as you get older and the condition usually occurs in people over the age of 65.

Dementia is a syndrome (a group of related symptoms) associated with an ongoing decline of the brain and its abilities. This includes problems with:

memory loss
thinking speed
mental agility
language
understanding
judgement
People with dementia can become apathetic or uninterested in their usual activities and have problems controlling their emotions. They may also find social situations challenging lose interest in socialising and aspects of their personality may change.

A person with dementia may lose empathy (understanding and compassion) they may see or hear things that other people do not (hallucinations) or they may make false claims or statements. 

As dementia affects a person's mental abilities they may find planning and organising difficult. Maintaining their independence may also become a problem. A person with dementia will therefore usually need help from friends or relatives including help with decision making.","Dementia is caused by gradual changes and damage in the brain. The most common causes of dementia include diseases in which the brain cells degenerate and die more quickly than they would as part of the normal ageing process. The changes usually happen because of a build-up of abnormal proteins in the brain.

This damage leads to a decline in a person's mental and sometimes physical abilities.

The abnormal proteins are different in each type of these kinds of dementia. In most cases dementia is not inherited directly from family members. ","Most types of dementia cannot be cured and will gradually cause more severe problems.

But there are important exceptions including dementia caused by vitamin and thyroid hormone deficiencies which can be treated with supplements.

Some causes can be treated surgically – for example some brain tumours excess fluid on the brain (hydrocephalus) or head injury.

For types of dementia that involve degeneration of nerve and brain tissue you can take action to prevent further damage. It's possible to do this by reducing dementia risk factors such as by managing high blood pressure high cholesterol type 1 diabetes and stopping smoking.

For dementia that currently cannot be cured some types of medicine may prevent symptoms getting worse for a period of time. These medicines are usually given to people in the early and middle stages of the disease to try to maintain or improve their independence.

It is fairly common for people with dementia to have depression. If you have dementia and depression your GP may consider prescribing an antidepressant medication or get you an appointment with a psychiatrist who specialises in working with older people.

You can catch flu all year round but it's especially common in winter which is why it's also known as seasonal flu.

Flu isn't the same as the common cold. Flu is caused by a different group of viruses and the symptoms tend to start more suddenly be more severe and last longer. It can sometimes be difficult to tell if you have flu or just a cold as the symptoms can be quite similar. The main differences are:

Flu symptoms:
come on quickly
usually include fever and aching muscles
make you feel too unwell to continue your usual activities
Cold symptoms:
come on gradually
mainly affect your nose and throat
are fairly mild so you can still get around and are usually well enough to go to work","Flu is caused by virus. The flu virus is contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when someone who is infected coughs or sneezes.These droplets typically spread about one metre. They hang suspended in the air for a while before landing on surfaces where the virus can survive for up to 24 hours.

Anyone who breathes in the droplets can catch flu. You can also catch the virus by touching the surfaces that the droplets have landed on if you pick up the virus on your hands and then touch your nose or mouth.

Everyday items at home and in public places can easily become contaminated with the flu virus including food door handles remote controls handrails telephone handsets and computer keyboards. Therefore it's important to wash your hands frequently.

You can catch flu many times because flu viruses change regularly and your body won't have a natural resistance to the new versions.","f you're otherwise fit and healthy there's usually no need to see your GP if you have flu-like symptoms.  The best remedy is to rest at home keep warm and drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration. You can take paracetamol or ibuprofen to lower a high temperature and relieve aches if necessary.

are 65 or over
are pregnant
have a lung heart kidney liver or neurological disease
have a weakened immune system

Iron is used to produce red blood cells which help store and carry oxygen in the blood. If you have fewer red blood cells than is normal your organs and tissues won't get as much oxygen as they usually would.

There are several different types of anaemia and each one has a different cause. Iron deficiency anaemia is the most common type.

Other types of anaemia can be caused by a lack of vitamin B12 or folate in the body. ","There are many things that can lead to a lack of iron in the body. In men and post-menopausal women the most common cause is bleeding in the stomach and intestines.

This can be caused by a stomach ulcer stomach cancer bowel cancer or by taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

In women of reproductive age heavy periods and pregnancy are the most common causes of iron deficiency anaemia as your body needs extra iron for your baby during pregnancy.

Unless you're pregnant it's rare for iron deficiency anaemia to be caused just by a lack of iron in your diet. However if you do lack dietary iron it may mean you're more likely to develop anaemia than if you have one of the problems mentioned above.","Treatment for iron deficiency anaemia involves taking iron supplements to boost the low levels of iron in your body. This is usually effective and the condition rarely causes long-term problems.

If treated promptly a kidney infection doesn't cause serious harm but will make you feel very unwell. If a kidney infection isn't treated it can get worse and cause permanent kidney damage.

Symptoms of a kidney infection often come on within a few hours. You can feel feverish shivery sick and have a pain in your back or side.","A kidney infection usually happens when bacteria – often a type called E. coli – gets into the urethra (the tube which carries urine out of the body) and travels up through the bladder and into the kidneys.  The bacteria get in through the opening of the urethra and move upwards through your urinary tract first infecting your bladder and then your kidneys.

It's thought the bacteria can get into your urinary tract by accidentally spreading from your anus to your urethra. This can happen if you wipe your bottom after going to the toilet and the soiled toilet paper comes into contact with your genitals. It can also happen during sex.

In rare cases a kidney infection can develop if bacteria or fungi infect the skin and the infection spreads through your bloodstream into your kidney. However this type of infection usually only occurs in people with weakened immune systems. Kidney infections are relatively rare.  They can happen at any age but are much more common in women. In fact women are six times more likely to get a kidney infection than men. This is because a woman's urethra is shorter making it easier for bacteria to reach the kidneys.

Younger women are most at risk because they tend to be more sexually active and having frequent sex increases the chances of getting a kidney infection.

Younger children are also vulnerable to developing kidney infections because they may be born with an abnormality of the urinary tract or have a condition called vesico-ureteric reflux where there is a backflow of urine from the bladder up to the kidneys.","Most people with a kidney infection can be treated at home with a course of antibiotics and possibly painkillers as well.

Otitis externa is often referred to as ""swimmer's ear"" because repeated exposure to water can make the ear canal more vulnerable to inflammation. ","Most cases of otitis externa are caused by a bacterial infection although the condition can also be caused by:
irritation
fungal infections
allergies
There are a number of things that can make you more likely to develop otitis externa including:
damaging the skin inside your ear
regularly getting water in your ear
Getting water in your ear is particularly significant because this can cause you to scratch inside your ear and the moisture also provides an ideal environment for bacteria to grow.","Otitis externa can usually be treated effectively with ear drops prescribed by your GP and some simple self-care techniques. While otitis externa can clear up by itself this can take several weeks without treatment. Your GP can usually prescribe medicated ear drops that speed up the healing process. These usually need to be taken several times a day for about a week.

There are four main types of ear drops used to treat otitis externa:

antibiotic ear drops – this can treat an underlying bacterial infection
corticosteroid ear drops – this can help to reduce swelling
antifungal ear drops – this can treat an underlying fungal infection
acidic ear drops – this can help kill bacteria

Tonsillitis is a common condition in children teenagers and young adults.   The tonsils are two small glands that sit on either side of the throat. In young children they help to fight germs and act as a barrier against infection.

When the tonsils become infected they isolate the infection and stop it spreading further into the body.

As a child's immune system develops and gets stronger the tonsils become less important and usually shrink. In most people the body is able to fight infection without the tonsils.","Most cases of tonsillitis are caused by a viral infection such as the viruses that cause the common cold or flu virus (influenza).

Some cases can also be caused by a bacterial infection typically a strain of bacteria called group A streptococcus bacteria.

These types of infections spread easily so it's important to try to avoid passing the infection on to others by:

staying away from public places such as work school or nursery until your GP says it's safe to return (usually after the symptoms have passed)
coughing and sneezing into a tissue and disposing of the tissue 
washing hands before eating after going to the toilet and if possible after coughing and sneezing","There's no specific treatment for tonsillitis but you may be able to reduce the symptoms by:

taking paracetamol or ibuprofen to help relieve pain
drinking plenty of fluids
getting plenty of rest
If test results show that your tonsillitis is caused by a bacterial infection a short course of oral antibiotics may be prescribed.

If oral antibiotics aren't effective at treating bacterial tonsillitis intravenous antibiotics (given directly into a vein) may be needed in hospital.  In most cases tonsillitis gets better within a week. However a small number of children and adults have tonsillitis for longer or it keeps returning. This is known as chronic tonsillitis and surgical treatment may be needed.

Surgery to remove the tonsils (a tonsillectomy) is usually only recommended if:

Three out of four cases occur at night during sleep.","Leg cramps can occur for no apparent reason known as idiopathic leg cramps or as a symptom or complication of a health condition known as secondary leg cramps.

Causes of secondary leg cramps can include:
pregnancy
exercise 
certain types of medication such as statins (medicines that help lower cholesterol levels)
liver disease
During a cramp your muscles suddenly contract (shorten) causing pain in your leg. This is known as a spasm and you cannot control the affected muscle.

The cramp can last from a few seconds to 10 minutes. When the spasm passes you will be able to control the affected muscle again.","If the cause of your leg cramps is known it may be possible to treat the underlying cause.

For example secondary leg cramps that are related to liver disease are caused by high levels of toxins in the blood which trigger muscles spasms. Therefore muscle relaxants can be used to help prevent your muscles from going into spasm.

If the cause of your legs cramps is unknown (primary idiopathic leg cramps) a combination of exercise and painkilling medication is usually recommended. Most cases of leg cramps can be treated with exercises. There are two types of exercise that you can do:

exercises you do during an episode of cramping to relieve the pain and stop the cramping

migraine with aura – where there are specific warning signs just before the migraine begins such as seeing flashing lights
migraine without aura – the most common type where the migraine occurs without the specific warning signs
migraine aura without headache also known as silent migraine – where an aura or other migraine symptoms are experienced but a headache doesn't develop

The exact causes are not known but there are several factors thought to increase your risk of developing the condition.

As part of normal life your joints are exposed to a constant low level of damage. In most cases your body will repair the damage itself. Usually the repair process will pass unnoticed and you will not experience any symptoms.

However in cases of osteoarthritis the damage to the joints is not fully repaired and instead some of the cartilage (the protective surface that allows your joints to move smoothly) in the joint can be lost bony growths can develop and the area can become slightly inflamed (red and swollen).

These changes are what cause the typical symptoms of pain stiffness and swelling.","Exercise is one of the most important treatments for people with osteoarthritis whatever your age or level of fitness. Your physical activity should include a combination of exercises to strengthen your muscles and exercises to improve your general fitness.

If osteoarthritis causes you pain and stiffness you may think exercise will make your symptoms worse.

Excess levels of thyroid hormones can then speed up the body’s metabolism triggering a range of symptoms such as:
nervousness and anxiety
hyperactivity – where a person can’t stay still and is full of nervous energy
unexplained or unplanned weight loss 
swelling of the thyroid gland which causes a noticeable lump known as a goitre to form in the throat
The severity frequency and range of symptoms can vary from person to person.","The thyroid gland is found in the neck. It produces hormones that are released into the bloodstream to control the body's growth and metabolism. These hormones are called thyroxine and triiodothyronine.

They affect processes such as heart rate and body temperature and help convert food into energy to keep the body going.

In hyperthyroidism the thyroid gland produces too much thyroxine or triiodothyronine which speeds up the body's metabolism.

There are several possible underlying causes the most common being Graves' disease in which the body's immune system targets the thyroid gland and causes it to produce too much of the thyroid hormones.","An overactive thyroid usually responds well to treatment and most people are able to control their symptoms.

The three most widely used treatments for an overactive thyroid gland are:

thionamides – a group of medications including carbimazole and methimazole that stop the thyroid gland producing too much thyroid hormone
radioiodine treatment – a radioactive substance called iodine that helps shrink the thyroid gland reducing its activity (the radiation contained in iodine is a very low dose and does not pose a threat to health)
surgery – in a small number of cases surgery may be required to remove some or all of the thyroid gland particularly if there is a large goitre
Beta-blockers may also sometimes be used to temporarily relieve many symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland although it doesn't target the thyroid gland itself.

Haemorrhoids aren't usually painful unless their blood supply slows down or is interrupted.","The exact cause of haemorrhoids is unclear but they're associated with increased pressure in the blood vessels in and around your anus. This pressure can cause the blood vessels in your back passage to become swollen and inflamed.

Many cases are thought to be caused by too much straining on the toilet due to prolonged constipation – this is often due to a lack of fibre in a person's diet. Chronic (long-term) diarrhoea can also make you more vulnerable to getting haemorrhoids.","Haemorrhoid symptoms often settle down after a few days without needing treatment. Haemorrhoids that occur during pregnancy often get better after giving birth.

However making lifestyle changes to reduce the strain on the blood vessels in and around your anus is often recommended. These can include:

gradually increasing the amount of fibre in your diet – good sources of fibre include fruit vegetables wholegrain rice wholewheat pasta and bread pulses and beans seeds nuts and oats
drinking plenty of fluid – particularly water but avoiding or cutting down on caffeine and alcohol
not delaying going to the toilet – ignoring the urge to empty your bowels can make your stools harder and drier which can lead to straining when you do go to the toilet
avoiding medication that causes constipation – such as painkillers that contain codeine
losing weight (if you're overweight)
exercising regularly – can help prevent constipation reduce your blood pressure and help you lose weight
These measures can also reduce the risk of haemorrhoids returning or even developing in the first place.

Medication that you apply directly to your back passage (known as topical treatments) or tablets bought from a pharmacy or prescribed by your GP may ease your symptoms and make it easier for you to pass stools.

There are various treatment options for more severe haemorrhoids. One of these options is banding which is a non-surgical procedure where a very tight elastic band is put around the base of the haemorrhoid to cut off its blood supply. The haemorrhoid should fall off after about a week.

ethnic group – prostate cancer is more common among men of African-Caribbean and African descent than in men of Asian descent.
family history – having a brother or father who developed prostate cancer under the age of 60 seems to increase the risk of you developing it. Research also shows that having a close female relative who developed breast cancer may also increase your risk of developing prostate cancer. 
obesity – recent research suggests that there may be a link between obesity and prostate cancer.
exercise – men who regularly exercise have also been found to be at lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
diet – research is ongoing into the links between diet and prostate cancer. There is evidence that a diet high in calcium is linked to an increased risk of developing prostate cancer.
In addition some research has shown that prostate cancer rates appear to be lower in men who eat foods containing certain nutrients including lycopene found in cooked tomatoes and other red fruit and selenium found in brazil nuts. However more research is needed.","For many men with prostate cancer treatment is not immediately necessary.

If it's not clear what's causing low blood pressure or no treatment exists the goal is to raise your blood pressure and reduce signs and symptoms. Depending on your age health and the type of low blood pressure you have you can do this in several ways: increasing salt intake drinking more water using compression stockings and medications.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/low-blood-pressure/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355470,TRUE,65,100,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0.00,50.00,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE
lactose intolerance,diarrhoea,stomach,nausea and vomiting,mouth,stomach cramps,stomach,bloating,stomach,gas,stomach,"People with lactose intolerance are unable to fully digest the sugar (lactose) in milk. As a result they have diarrhea gas and bloating after eating or drinking dairy products. The condition which is also called lactose malabsorption is usually harmless but its symptoms can be uncomfortable.

Too little of an enzyme produced in your small intestine (lactase) is usually responsible for lactose intolerance. You can have low levels of lactase and still be able to digest milk products. But if your levels are too low you become lactose intolerant leading to symptoms after you eat or drink dairy.

Most people with lactose intolerance can manage the condition without having to give up all dairy foods.","Lactose intolerance occurs when your small intestine doesn't produce enough of an enzyme (lactase) to digest milk sugar (lactose).

Normally lactase turns milk sugar into two simple sugars — glucose and galactose — which are absorbed into the bloodstream through the intestinal lining.

If you're lactase deficient lactose in your food moves into the colon instead of being processed and absorbed. In the colon normal bacteria interact with undigested lactose causing the signs and symptoms of lactose intolerance.","In people with lactose intolerance caused by an underlying condition treating the condition might restore the body's ability to digest lactose although that process can take months. For other causes you might avoid the discomfort of lactose intolerance by following a low-lactose diet.

To lower the amount of lactose in your diet:

Limit milk and other dairy products
Include small servings of dairy products in your regular meals
Eat and drink lactose-reduced ice cream and milk
Add a liquid or powder lactase enzyme to milk to break down the lactose",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lactose-intolerance/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20374238,FALSE,1,100,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0.00,50.00,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
laryngitis,Hoarseness,throat,Weak voice or voice loss,throat,Tickling sensation and rawness in your throat,throat,sore throat,throat,dry cough ,throat,"Laryngitis is an inflammation of your voice box (larynx) from overuse irritation or infection.

Inside the larynx are your vocal cords — two folds of mucous membrane covering muscle and cartilage. Normally your vocal cords open and close smoothly forming sounds through their movement and vibration.

But with laryngitis your vocal cords become inflamed or irritated. This makes the vocal cords swell which distorts the sounds produced by air passing over them. As a result your voice sounds hoarse. In some cases of laryngitis your voice can become almost undetectable.

Laryngitis may be short-lived (acute) or long lasting (chronic). Most cases of laryngitis are triggered by a temporary viral infection and aren't serious. Persistent hoarseness can sometimes signal a more serious underlying medical condition.","Most cases of laryngitis are temporary and improve after the underlying cause gets better. Causes of acute laryngitis include:

Viral infections similar to those that cause a cold
Vocal strain caused by yelling or overusing your voice
Bacterial infections although these are less common","Acute laryngitis often gets better on its own within a week or so. Self-care measures such as voice rest drinking fluids and humidifying your air also can help improve symptoms.

Chronic laryngitis treatments are aimed at treating the underlying causes such as heartburn smoking or excessive use of alcohol.

Medications used in some cases include:

Antibiotics. In almost all cases of laryngitis an antibiotic won't do any good because the cause is usually viral. But if you have a bacterial infection your doctor may recommend an antibiotic.
Corticosteroids. Sometimes corticosteroids can help reduce vocal cord inflammation. However this treatment is used only when there's an urgent need to treat laryngitis — such as in some cases when a toddler has laryngitis associated with croup.
You may also have voice therapy to learn to lessen behaviors that worsen your voice.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/laryngitis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20374267,FALSE,1,100,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0.00,50.00,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
Thalassemia,Fatigue,entire body,weakness,entire body,Pale or yellowish skin,skin,Slow growth,entire body,Abdominal swelling,stomach,"Thalassemia (thal-uh-SEE-me-uh) is an inherited blood disorder that causes your body to have less hemoglobin than normal. Hemoglobin enables red blood cells to carry oxygen. Thalassemia can cause anemia leaving you fatigued.

If you have mild thalassemia you might not need treatment. But more severe forms might require regular blood transfusions. ","Thalassemia is caused by mutations in the DNA of cells that make hemoglobin — the substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout your body. The mutations associated with thalassemia are passed from parents to children.

Hemoglobin molecules are made of chains called alpha and beta chains that can be affected by mutations. In thalassemia the production of either the alpha or beta chains are reduced resulting in either alpha-thalassemia or beta-thalassemia.

In alpha-thalassemia the severity of thalassemia you have depends on the number of gene mutations you inherit from your parents. The more mutated genes the more severe your thalassemia.

In beta-thalassemia the severity of thalassemia you have depends on which part of the hemoglobin molecule is affected.","Mild forms of thalassemia trait don't need treatment.

For moderate to severe thalassemia treatments might include:
Frequent blood transfusions. More severe forms of thalassemia often require frequent blood transfusions possibly every few weeks. Over time blood transfusions cause a buildup of iron in your blood which can damage your heart liver and other organs.
Chelation therapy. This is treatment to remove excess iron from your blood. Iron can build up as a result of regular transfusions. 
To help rid your body of the extra iron you might need to take an oral medication such as deferasirox (Exjade Jadenu) or deferiprone (Ferriprox). Another drug deferoxamine (Desferal) is given by needle.
Stem cell transplant. Also called a bone marrow transplant a stem cell transplant might be an option in some cases. For children with severe thalassemia it can eliminate the need for lifelong blood transfusions and drugs to control iron overload. This procedure involves receiving infusions of stem cells from a compatible donor usually a sibling.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thalassemia/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355001,FALSE,1,100,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0.00,50.00,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The noise you hear when you have tinnitus isn't caused by an external sound and other people usually can't hear it. Tinnitus is a common problem. It affects about 15% to 20% of people and is especially common in older adults.

Tinnitus is usually caused by an underlying condition such as age-related hearing loss an ear injury or a problem with the circulatory system. For many people tinnitus improves with treatment of the underlying cause or with other treatments that reduce or mask the noise making tinnitus less noticeable.",A number of health conditions can cause or worsen tinnitus. In many cases an exact cause is never found.  In many people tinnitus is caused by one of the following: hearing loss ear canal blockage or ear infectionmedications head or neck injuries.  Less common causes of tinnitus include other ear problems chronic health conditions and injuries or conditions that affect the nerves in your ear or the hearing center in your brain.,"Treatment for tinnitus depends on whether your tinnitus is caused by an underlying health condition. If so your doctor may be able to reduce your symptoms by treating the underlying cause. Examples include:
Earwax removal. Removing an earwax blockage can decrease tinnitus symptoms.
Treating a blood vessel condition. Underlying blood vessel conditions may require medication surgery or another treatment to address the problem.
Hearing aids. If your tinnitus is caused by noise-induced or age-related hearing loss using hearing aids may help improve your symptoms.
Changing your medication. If a medication you're taking appears to be the cause of tinnitus your doctor may recommend stopping or reducing the drug or switching to a different medication.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tinnitus/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350162,FALSE,1,100,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0.00,50.00,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
